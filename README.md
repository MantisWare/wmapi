## Quick start

We've been working on a major update to mwapi for several months now, rewriting the core framework and the administration panel. Performances has been increased, Developer eXperience has been improved and a brand new plugins
ecosystem has been introduced. **Both versions are available, we still recommend you to use v1 for production usage.**.

#### Alpha

The alpha has support for the latest version of Node.js (v8) and npm (v5).
```bash
npm install mwapi@alpha -g
```

#### Stable
This is the production-ready version of mwapi (v1). You should also consider that the migration to v3 will not be easy due to many breaking changes.
```bash
npm install mwapi -g
```

## Philosophy ?

> At [mwapi](https://mwapi.io), everything we do we believe in changing the status quo of web development. Our products are simple to use, user friendly and production-ready.

Web and mobile applications needed a powerful, simple to use and production-ready API-driven solution. That's why we created mwapi, an open-source Content Management Framework (CMF) for exposing your content (data, media) accross multi-devices.

Halfway between a CMS and a framework, mwapi takes advantages of both worlds. A powerful dashboard to easily manage your content with a flexible framework layer to develop and integrate specific features.
