# mwapi-redis

This built-in hook allows you to use [Redis](https://redis.io/) as a databases connection. Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker.

## Motivation

We developed this hook to use Redis as cache database for our mwapi apps.
