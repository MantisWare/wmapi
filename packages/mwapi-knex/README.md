# mwapi-knex

This built-in hook allows you to directly make SQL queries from your mwapi connections to your databases thanks to the [Knex node module](http://knexjs.org/).

[Knex](http://knexjs.org/) is a "batteries included" SQL query builder for SQLite3, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle designed to be flexible, portable, and fun to use.

It features both traditional Node.js style callbacks as well as a promise interface for cleaner async flow control, a stream interface, full featured query and schema builders, transaction support (with savepoints), connection pooling and standardized responses between different query clients and dialects.
